Ship Manager (C++)
- A C++ program that demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts by modeling different ship types using inheritance and polymorphism.


Description:
- This project is a C++ Object-Oriented Programming demonstration that models ships using a class hierarchy. A base Ship class defines common attributes, while cruiseShip and cargoShip extend the base class with specialized data and behavior.

- The program stores different ship types using base-class pointers and relies on virtual functions to enable runtime polymorphism. This allows each ship object to respond differently to the same function call, depending on its actual type. The project also demonstrates proper dynamic memory management and clean class organization using header files.
